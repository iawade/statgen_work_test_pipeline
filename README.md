# Other things I'd want in the pipeline if it were real data and I had more time

## General
* check sequencing/genoyping platform and adjust QC accordingly

## Sample QC/ Sample Selection
* X inbreeding - check for sample mix ups
* PCA for cryptic and divergent ancestry (and covariates in GWAS)
* test for duplicate samples
* HapMap concordance

## Site QC
* some kind of depth filter
* filter on QUAL?

# Regression
* include more rarer variants (Rare variation, common disease hypothesis)
* update method for regression to account for rare variants, covariates and family structure
* Covariates (assuming the phenotype is BMI or something similar): age, sex, socioeconmic background, chronic disease, [height?]  

## QQ 
* Inflation - before and after QC
* Use genomic control method and calculate inflation factor

## Other
* imputation
